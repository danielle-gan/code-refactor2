# Horiseon Code Refactoring

## User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Overview

Built off of a preexisting repository for a marketing agency, this web platform was refactored for marketing agencies to showcase their services and optimize their online presence. The primary goal is to ensure that the codebase adheres to accessibility standards, enhancing the website's search engine optimization (SEO) and providing an inclusive user experience. 

## Accessibility Standards

The codebase is developed with a strong focus on accessibility standards, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the site easily. Key aspects of accessibility include:

- **Semantic HTML:** The use of semantic HTML elements for proper structure and meaningful content.

- **Logical Structure:**: The HTML elements follow a structure independent of styling and positioning and the headers fall in sequential order. 

- **Responsive Design:** A responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.

- **Alt Text for Images:** Descriptive alt text is provided for all images to ensure a rich user experience for screen reader users.

- **Keyboard Navigation:** The website is navigable and functional using only a keyboard, promoting accessibility for users who rely on keyboard navigation.

## Improvements from V1

The initial refactoring project did not inlcude responsive design or the accessibility considerations of using a keyboard.
